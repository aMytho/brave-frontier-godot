unit_lore = "A warrior from the ruined Atharva Republic, he later became one of the Six Heroes. Raised in an old mine, he worked from the time he was a child. At one point he grew tired and left to become a demon bounty hunter. His swordsmanship was tempered through his mine work, and he could obliterate a normal demon in one blow. He spoke rough, but was polite to women."
